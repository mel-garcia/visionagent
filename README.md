Submitted by: Andhy Gonzalez, Melissa Garcia, David Jacquet, Giovanni Rodriguez

## Elevator Pitch

VisionAgent empowers accessibility by summarizing webpage content, improving productivity, and enabling fast and easy comprehension for all users, especially those relying on screen readers.

## Project Story

VisionAgent has the desire to improve online accessibility in the most productive way possible. While browsing websites, we noticed that users with disabilities face significant challenges consuming content. Our mission was to create a tool that bridges this gap and facilitates a more efficient online experience for everyone.

## About the project

**Inspiration**
This project aims to help with productivity by facilitating getting the main points of a webpage. This ultimately boosts accesibility and inclusivity.

**What it does**

VisionAgent processes a URL, reads the content of the page, and outputs a concise, meaningful summary. This helps users quickly grasp the page's purpose and main ideas.

**How we built it**
We utilized:

- Front end: React, Vite, jsx

- Back end: Python for orchestrating model execution.

- Agentverse: A framework for creating and managing a web-scraper agent to fetch webpage content.

- GitHub: To collaborate effectively and manage version control.

**Challenges we ran into**

- Performance Optimization: Making the solution fast and efficient for real-time usage required extensive testing and fine-tuning.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
- Creating a tool that can impact accessibility positively and contribute to inclusivity.

- Overcoming complex web-scraping challenges to achieve robust functionality.

**What we learned**
- The importance of accessibility in design and technology.

- Techniques for fine-tuning and integrating machine learning models.

- The value of collaboration and iterative development.

**What's next**

VisionAgent has the potential to:

- Include voiced summaries and navigation, allowing users to hear and act on page content suggestions.

## Built with
 
- Languages: Python, React, Vite, jsx

- Frameworks: Agentverse

- APIs: Web-scraper integration for dynamic content retrieval and Claude API that is a programming interface provided by Anthropic that allows integration of the capabilities of the Claude language model.

- Tools: GitHub for collaboration and version control
