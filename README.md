## Project - *Vision Agent*
Submitted by: Andhy Gonzalez, Melissa Garcia, David Jacquet, Giovanni Rodriguez

## Elevator Pitch

VisionAgent empowers accessibility by summarizing webpage content, improving productivity, and enabling easy comprehension for all users, especially those relying on screen readers.

## Project Story

VisionAgent has the desire to improve online accessibility in the most productive way possible. While browsing websites, we noticed that users with disabilities face significant challenges navigating and consuming content. Our mission was to create a tool that bridges this gap and facilitates a smoother online experience for everyone.

## About the project

**Inspiration**
This project aims to help with accesibility, facilitating not only screen reading but providing context of the content of a webpage. This ultimately boosts productivity and inclusivity.

**What it does**

VisionAgent processes a URL, reads the content of the page, and outputs a concise, meaningful summary. This helps users quickly grasp the page's purpose and main ideas.

**How we built it**
We utilized:

- Front end: React, Vite, jsx

- Back end: Python

- Hugging Face Transformers python package: to integrate a BART model for text summarization.

- Agentverse: A framework for creating and managing a web-scraper agent to fetch webpage content.

- Python: For implementing the backend and orchestrating model execution.

- GitHub: To collaborate effectively and manage version control.

**Challenges we ran into**
- Data Variability: Handling different webpage structures and content layouts was challenging, as no two websites are formatted identically.

- Model Tuning: Ensuring the summarization model produced coherent and accurate summaries without omitting critical details.

- Performance Optimization: Making the solution fast and efficient for real-time usage required extensive testing and fine-tuning.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**
- Successfully integrating a state-of-the-art summarization model into a user-friendly application.

- Creating a tool that can impact accessibility positively and contribute to inclusivity.

- Overcoming complex web-scraping and data variability challenges to achieve robust functionality.

**What we learned**
- The importance of accessibility in design and technology.

- Techniques for fine-tuning and integrating machine learning models.

- The value of collaboration and iterative development.

**What's next**

VisionAgent has the potential to:

- Include voiced navigation options, allowing users to hear and act on page content suggestions.

- Extend functionality to summarize multi-page documents or applications.

- Support multilingual summarization to cater to a diverse global audience.
